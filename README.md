Immunotherapy-Neural-Network
-----
This project uses a simple neural network created from scratch in python to predict the results of immunotherapy treatment given several characteristics of patients. Although not perfect, this simple neural network was created to practice prominent techniques and algorithms used in AI and machine learning.  

The dependencies in this project are numpy and sympy.  

The following introduction to AI and neural networks were done as a part of a grade 11 computer science research project on emerging technologies.

## What is a neural network?
