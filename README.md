Immunotherapy-Neural-Network
-----
This project uses a simple neural network created from scratch in python to predict the results of immunotherapy treatment given several characteristics of patients. Although not perfect, this simple neural network was created to practice prominent techniques and algorithms used in AI and machine learning.  

The dependencies in this project are numpy and sympy.
